# Asepsis (ALPHA)

### The final solution for .DS_Store pollution. 

Available for folks running Lion.

## What is .DS_Store?

It is pretty famous file which got its own page on wikipedia. Please read [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store).

## How does .DS_Store redirection work?

There is a private system framework DesktopServicesPriv which is responsible for creating and manipulating .DS_Store files. This framework is used mainly by Finder, but there are also other apps which link against it and may use it (yes mdworker I'm looking at you!).

DesktopServicesPriv was modified in Lion and now uses standard libc calls to manipulate .DS_Store files which enabled this solution.

At core Asepsis provides a dynamic library libAsepsis.dylib which gets loaded into every process thanks to DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES. It interposes some libc calls used by DesktopServicesPriv to access .DS_Store files. Interposed functions detect paths talking about .DS_Store files and redirect them into a special prefix directory. This seems to be transparent to DesktopServicesPriv.

Additionally Asepsis implements a kernel extension and an user-space system-wide daemon whose purpose is to monitor system-wide folder renames and deletes and mirror those operations in prefixed folder. This is best we can do. This way you don't lose your settings after renaming folders, because rename is also executed on folders in the prefix directory.

## The prefix direcotry is **/usr/local/.dscage**

This project implements:

  1. libAsepsis.dylib - a shared library for interposing file manipulation calls
  2. Asepsis.kext - a kernel extension for watching folder operations
  3. asepsisd - a system-wide daemon for mirroring folder renames and deletes in prefixed folder
  4. asepsisctl - a command-line utility for controlling asepsis operation

## Installation

You will need XCode4 for building from sources

    git clone https://github.com/binaryage/asepsis
    cd asepsis
    rake build
    rake install
    sudo bash -c "echo \"setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /System/Library/Extensions/Asepsis.kext/Contents/Resources/libAsepsis.dylib\" >> /etc/launchd.conf"
    sudo reboot
    
Note: you may want to edit launchd.conf manually    

for installing debug version which is more verbose in Console.app use `rake build_debug` instead of `rake build`
    
TODO: provide a nice installer in the future.

## Uninstallation

    cd asepsis
    rake uninstall

## Controlling asepsis operation via asepsisctl

During installation asepsisctl command-line tool is symlinked into /usr/local/bin, so it should be visible from command-line.

    ~/code/asepsis master âž” asepsisctl --help
    The control script for asepsis operations.

    Usage:
       asepsisctl [command] [options]

    Commands:
       suspend                           Suspends immediate asepsis operations.
       disable                           Disables asepsis.
       enable                            Enables asepsis.

    Where options are:
        -h, --help                       Show this message
        -v, --version                    Print version


## Known Issues

  * when copying folders, DS_Store settings are not copied over (daemon is unable to distinguish this class of file operations)
 
Please report any issues. Similar approach was used in TotalFinder for more than 2 years without troubles. It is not a perfect solution but it improves situation for people who don't care about .DS_Store files that much and can afford losing them from time to time.

## Is this safe?

Well uhmmm, use it at your own risk :-) It sounds scary but it should be a pretty lightweight solution. You should review the code to see what it does.

And if it helps you... I have been running Asepsis on my own machine for some time and I'm pretty happy about it.

## Why is this better than TotalFinder?

Thanks to DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES this solution is system-wide and applies to all processes using DesktopServicesPriv. Not only Finder. Also there is a timing problem with TotalFinder. The plugin gets usually injected into the Finder after some delay. Prior injection Finder is running and can touch some .DS_Store files and create pollution again. More than that! After injection it could cause internal state confusion because Finder has cached some of .DS_Store files in-memory already. For example ~/Desktop/.DS_Store was a common pain point. DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is a stable solution, because dydl interposes libc calls immediately at the point of dynamic linking, so there is no chance for asepsis to miss some calls. Btw. new Asepsis also fixes Spotlight comments which wasn't handled by TotalFinder solution.

## Could this be ported to Snow Leopard?

Probably yes. Pre-Lion DesktopServicesPriv calls File Manager APIs from CoreServices. Technically the same approach could be done to File Manager. Actually this is what TotalFinder (prior version 1.3) did under Snow Leopard using mach_override. I'm not going to implement it for Snow Leopard because I've already switched to Lion personally.

## History

Historically this functionality was implemented as part of [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com) which is a Finder plugin.

Here is what I did in TotalFinder:

  * I've redirected low-level filesystem calls which Finder.app does: 
    * Anytime Finder.app is asking to open `/some/folder/.DS_Store` file, I open it as `/usr/local/.dscache/some/folder/_DS_Store`
      * since TotalFinder 1.1.8, I'm checking if .DS_Store is present in `/some/folder/` - I'm not doing redirection when present.
    * This way Finder thinks files are at original places but they are being physically created in prefix folder, effectively sandboxing them
    * The only exception is the prefix folder itself, when you go and see it in the Finder, no redirection is applied
  * I've implemented kernel extension Echelon, which monitors folder renames (and deletes) and sends them to TotalFinder
    * You see why. This is important to keep DS_Store folder structure in prefix directory mirroring actual structure on the disk

Yeah, kernel extension sounds scary. But I didn't find a better solution in user-space. FSEvents are not precious enough (it just reports "something was changed"). BSD kqueues must be registered on per-file basis, so it is not usable in this scenario. In the end of the day that kernel extension turned out to be really light-weight solution. I use KAUTH API to monitor kernel filesystem events. I do it only if TotalFinder is connected and only for renames and deletes. Testing is simple C-string comparison and sending notification via socket.
